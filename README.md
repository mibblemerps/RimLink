# RimLink

> ### RimLink is currently in alpha.
> That means bugs, and could possibly include bugs that cause you to lose progress.

> ### RimLink requires Royalty at this point
> In future I hope to make most features work without royalty. For now this isn't a priority.

## Features

### 💱 Player Trading
This is done using the standard RimWorld trading interface.

Both parties get an easy overview of the trade, the market values involved, and the option to accept or reject.

### 🧤 Lending Colonists
Colonists can be lent to other players.
You can request silver in exchange for your colonists time.

### 😇 Not Returning Colonists Lent to You
No one says you *have* to return the colonists.

There are no arbitrary restrictions. You can arrest, kill or strip colonists lent to you. They will be notified of these actions, and it is up to them to retaliate.

### 🔬 Research Missions
Send your researcher off to another player to do some research away from home. You will both get the research points and your colonist will research faster.

It's mutually beneficial if you trust them to take good care of your colonist.

### ⛱ Holiday
Everyone needs a holiday. Let your colonists see the sights of other player's colonies for a mood buff (hopefully).

### 💰 Place Bounties
You can pay the local factions to send customisable raids on players.
You want an immediate drop pod raid in the center of their base? It can be done! 👍

Alternatively, if you're strapped for silver, a 20% strength, walk-in raid in a couple of days might have to do.

Or for maximum efficiency, research the language of the native tribes, and exploit their willingness to do the same work for less!

### 😈 Send Custom Mechanoid Clusters
If you're willing to pay the handsome fee, the mechanoids will allow you to make the decisions!
You can choose what you want in the mech cluster and they will do it.

- 1 inferno turret and a countdown activator set to 40 days? No worries 👍
- 10 proximity activators and 10 mech drop beacons? Technically sure! It'll be very expensive though!

### 💬 In-Game Chat
In-game chat is a critical component of doing *business on the Rim*.

### ❌ Anticheat
Worried your mates are filthy save scummers? Want to make sure everyone is on a level playing field?
Anticheat will force enable commitment mode, disable developer mode on that save, and immediately autosave whenever negative events happen.

*Anticheat is optional and configured on the server.*

## Isn't this just a bad version of [Zetrith's Multiplayer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1752864297)?
Zetrith's Multiplayer is a super impressive mod targeting a different kind of multiplayer experience than this mod.

## Known Issues
- Multiple colonies are not well handled.
- Sending of items with extra data (like persona monoswords) doesn't work
